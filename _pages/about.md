I'm a Computer Science student passionate about artificial intelligence and the mathematical theory behind machine learning systems. My journey into AI has been driven by a desire to understand the fundamental principles that make intelligent systems work.

## Current Projects

For updates on what I'm currently working on, check out my [blog section](/year-archive/), where I share new projects, experiments, and thoughts on AI, machine learning, and related topics.

## My Path to AI

My professional journey began at Tesla, where I spent several years working in **Facilities Engineering** and **Production Engineering**. During my time there, I gained valuable experience in:

- **Data Engineering**: Building ETL processes and data pipelines using Python and SQL
- **Manufacturing Analytics**: Implementing statistical process control and yield optimization
- **Computer Vision**: Troubleshooting and improving production line vision systems
- **Process Optimization**: Leading projects that improved line throughput by up to 41%
- **Reliability**: Developing predictive maintenance programs for mechanical and electrical equipment to enhance reliability and reduce probabilistic downtime

While I found the technical challenges at Tesla rewarding, I became increasingly fascinated by the mathematical foundations of artificial intelligence. The more I worked with data and automation systems, the more I wanted to understand the theoretical underpinnings of how machines can learn and make intelligent decisions.

## Academic Pursuit

This curiosity led me to pursue a **Master's in Computer Science & Engineering** at the University of Nevada, Reno, where I'm currently maintaining a 4.0 GPA. My academic focus is on:

- **Path Planning**: Studying algorithms and mathematical methods for navigation and decision-making in intelligent systems
- **Control Theory**: Exploring feedback systems and control mechanisms that enable robust and adaptive AI behavior
- **Mathematics Behind Modern AI Architectures**: Delving into the mathematical foundations that underpin contemporary neural networks and machine learning models
