## Article Goal
Explain CHOMP (Covariant Hamiltonian Optimization for Motion Planning) in detail with visualizations and code implementations.

## What is CHOMP?

CHOMP (Covariant Hamiltonian Optimization for Motion Planning) is a trajectory optimization algorithm that formulates motion planning as an optimization problem. It uses gradient-based optimization to find smooth, collision-free trajectories for robotic systems.

The intuitive explanation for CHOMP is that the objects can be thought of as magnets. The vehicle can be thought of as a manget with the same pole; the repulsive nature of the magnet pushes the magnet smoothly around the object. 

A straight line vector is made to the target, and the trajectory is warped as necessary to equalize the repulsive efforts from the obstacles in the environment. 

## Core Concepts

### 1. Trajectory Representation
CHOMP represents trajectories as a sequence of discrete waypoints in space. The trajectory is parameterized as a function of time.

### 2. Objective Function
The objective function in CHOMP consists of two main components:
- **Smoothness term**: Encourages smooth trajectories
- **Obstacle term**: Penalizes collisions with obstacles

### 3. Optimization
CHOMP uses gradient descent to minimize the objective function, iteratively improving the trajectory.

## Mathematical Formulation

The objective function is given by:

$$F(\xi) = \lambda_{obs} F_{obs}(\xi) + \lambda_{smooth} F_{smooth}(\xi)$$

Where:
- $F_{obs}(\xi)$ is the obstacle cost
- $F_{smooth}(\xi)$ is the smoothness cost
- $\lambda_{obs}$ and $\lambda_{smooth}$ are weighting parameters

## Simple Example

## Code Implementation
See Github


## Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity
- **Per iteration**: O(n * m) where n is number of waypoints, m is number of obstacles
- **Total**: O(k * n * m) where k is number of iterations

### Space Complexity
- **Trajectory storage**: O(n * d) where d is dimensionality
- **Gradient computation**: O(n * d)

## Advantages of CHOMP

1. **Smooth trajectories**: Natural smoothness through optimization
2. **Collision avoidance**: Explicit obstacle handling
3. **Scalability**: Works for high-dimensional configuration spaces
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to add custom cost terms

## Limitations

1. **Local minima**: Can get stuck in local optima
2. **Parameter tuning**: Requires careful tuning of Î» parameters
3. **Computational cost**: Can be expensive for complex environments
4. **Initial trajectory**: Quality depends on initial trajectory
